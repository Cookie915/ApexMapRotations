## About
 Apex Map Rotations taps into an unofficial apex legends API to give status updates on the current and upcoming maps.
 The app shows the data for both the battle royal and arena game modes. You can set alarms or notications to recieve 
 updates when the map changes. I build all the animations and icons for this app in house. Background images courtesy of
